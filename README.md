# Emotion-Recognition-System
Computer Vision Based Emotion Recognition System – Project Brief
This project focuses on recognizing human emotions in real time using computer vision and deep learning. By capturing facial expressions through a webcam, the system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER-2013 dataset to classify emotions into one of seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

Based on the detected emotion, the system responds interactively — by playing jokes, songs, or even sending SMS alerts in case of negative emotional states like sadness or fear. It uses tools like OpenCV for face detection, Keras/TensorFlow for emotion classification, Spotify API for music playback, Tkinter for GUI, and Twilio for SMS notifications.

The project aims to support mental well-being and human-computer interaction by acting not just as a detector, but as an emotionally responsive assistant.
